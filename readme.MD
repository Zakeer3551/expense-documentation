## 👋 Hi, I’m Zak

I’m an IT professional with **8+ years of industry experience**, with the last **~5 years focused heavily on DevOps, cloud infrastructure, and platform engineering**.

My background spans traditional IT systems, tooling, and operations, and over the years my role has evolved toward **automating infrastructure, enabling CI/CD, and running production-grade systems at scale**.

---

## 🧠 What I Focus On

I specialize in **taking existing applications and making them production-ready**.  
That includes everything *around* the application — not necessarily writing business logic.

My core areas of work include:

- Designing **cloud infrastructure** using Infrastructure as Code
- Building **CI/CD pipelines** for reliable, repeatable deployments
- Containerizing applications and deploying them to **Kubernetes**
- Implementing **scaling, resiliency, and rollback strategies**
- Setting up **monitoring, logging, and alerting**
- Applying **security best practices** across infra and pipelines

This mirrors how DevOps works in real organizations — where application code already exists and the challenge is operating it reliably.

## 📦 About the Projects in This Profile

Most repositories here follow a consistent philosophy:

> **Application code is often used as a reference workload**, while  
> **all infrastructure, CI/CD, deployment automation, and operational tooling are implemented by me**.

Each project is designed to demonstrate:
- Real-world DevOps decision-making
- Production-grade architecture
- Automation over manual processes
- Clear documentation and repeatability

Where application source code is referenced from public projects, **attribution is always provided**, and ownership is claimed only for DevOps-related work.

## 🚀 What You’ll See in My Repos

- End-to-end CI/CD pipelines (build → test → deploy → rollback)
- Kubernetes deployments with autoscaling and ingress
- Terraform-based cloud infrastructure
- Monitoring and alerting setups
- Architecture documentation and diagrams

These repositories are intentionally structured to reflect **how DevOps engineers work in real teams**, not toy examples.

---

## 🎯 What I’m Aiming For

I’m actively preparing for **Senior / Staff DevOps Engineer roles**, focusing on:
- Cloud-native platforms
- Highly available systems
- Automation-first environments
- Reliability and scalability at production scale
